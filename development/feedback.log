âœ“ All systems functional

Suggestions:  
1. **Documentation Enhancement:** Consider adding inline comments within `aeri_oms_v2.py` to explain critical sections of the code. This will help new developers quickly understand the logic and make future updates more streamlined.
  
2. **Testing:** Implement unit tests, especially for the new runway queue/slot scheduling and delay tracking features, to ensure reliability and catch any potential bugs early.

3. **User Feedback Loop:** Set up a feedback loop or issue tracker for users to report any issues or suggest improvements, particularly for the new features like takeoff sequencing and CSV logging.

4. **Performance Optimization:** As more features are added, consider profiling the simulation to identify any performance bottlenecks, especially if real-time processing is a goal.

5. **Expand README:** Include examples of the CSV log outputs in the `README.md`, so users know what to expect and how to interpret the data.

6. **Environment Simulation:** Begin exploring how changes in weather conditions could affect the new systems, as a precursor to adding weather diversions and advanced simulation scenarios.
